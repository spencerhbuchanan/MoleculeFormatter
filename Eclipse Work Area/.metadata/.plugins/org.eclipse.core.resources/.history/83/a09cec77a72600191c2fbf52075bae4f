 * Integration Project
 * PSI 1
 * 
 * Goals:          *List built-in data types
 *                 *Greet user
 *                  Define the term "variable"
 *                  Define the term "scope"
 *                  Describe a "final" variable
 *                  Describe what type casting is
 *                  Format a string with escape sequences
 *          
 * Requirements:    Use a boolean
 *                  Use an int
 *                  Use a double
 *                  Use a String
 *                  Use a final
 *                  Use typecasting
 *                 *Use escape sequences
